        I would like to create a README assistant prompt.
        I want to use an iterative approach.
        1. the user provides information about the repo and its content.
        2. the assistant asks any missing information if needed.
        3. the user answers
        4. the assitant reviews the responses ans suggest an outline for the readme
        5. the user iterates on the README with the assitant until it is validated

        Then begins the iterative process of writing section-by-section:
        6. Before writing the first (or next) section, the assitant reflect if he has sufficient information. If so he writes, if not he asks.
        7. The user reviews and asks modification until validated
        8. Do this until the README is done
    
        Use README best practices.
        Use Markdown conventions and write it in code blocks.
    </user>
    <thinking>
        Let me review what information I have and what I still need to create the README assistant prompt:
   
        1. **Context and task description**
           - ✓ The user provided detailed context about creating a README assistant prompt with a clear 8-step iterative approach across 3 phases (info gathering → outline creation → section-by-section writing)
           - ✓ They specified the iterative workflow with validation at each step
   
        2. **Will it be a system or user facing prompt?**
           - ❓ Given the complex multi-phase behavior and role definition, this seems like a system prompt, but I should confirm
   
        3. **Will chain of thought (CoT) be used?**
           - ❓ CoT would be valuable for the reflection steps where the assistant evaluates information sufficiency, but I need user confirmation
   
        4. **High level instructions or step-by-step guidance?**
           - ❓ The 8-step workflow suggests two possible approaches: prompt chaining (separate prompts for each phase) or a single comprehensive prompt with high-level instructions. This is a key architectural decision.
   
        5. **Do we need examples for the prompt?**
           - ❓ I need to ask about: iterative verification vs direct incorporation, number of examples, positive/negative examples, and whether to include &lt;thinking&gt; tags
   
        I have good context but need to clarify these key structural decisions before creating the optimal prompt.
    </thinking>
    <assistant>
        I'll help you create a README assistant prompt with that iterative approach. Let me ask a few clarifying questions:
    
        1. **[System Prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) or user-facing prompt?**
           - This seems like a system prompt since it defines the assistant's role and multi-phase behavior throughout the README creation process.
    
        2. **[Chain of thought](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)** (CoT):
           - CoT would be valuable here, especially for the reflection steps where the assistant evaluates if they have sufficient information before writing each section. Should I include CoT?
        3. **[Prompt Chaining](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts) or [High-Level Instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#use-general-instructions-first%2C-then-troubleshoot-with-more-step-by-step-instructions)?**
           - Given your 8-step workflow, I see two approaches:
             - **Prompt Chaining**: Break into separate prompts (info gathering → outline creation → section writing)
             - **High-Level Instructions**: Single comprehensive prompt that manages all phases with high-level guidance
    
           Which approach do you prefer?
    
        Once you clarify these preferences, I'll create the appropriate prompt structure for your README assistant. 
        ```
    </assistant>
    <user>
        1. System prompt
        2. Yes
        3. Prompt chaining
    </user>
    <thinking>
        The user has provided their preferences:
        - System prompt (not user-facing)
        - Chain of Thought should be included
        - Prompt chaining approach (separate prompts for each phase)

        Before I can create the prompt, I need to understand more about the README requirements. Key information I'm missing:
    
        1. **README structure**: What sections are mandatory vs optional? This will help me design the outline creation phase.
    
        2. **Flexibility**: Should the assistant be able to suggest project-specific sections beyond a standard template?
    
        3. **Writing style**: The tone and style will affect how the assistant writes each section.
    
        4. **Document management**: Should long sections be split into separate files? This affects the writing phase instructions.
    
        These details are crucial for creating a prompt that produces READMEs aligned with the user's standards and expectations.
    </thinking>
    <assistant>

        I need to understand more about the README structure and guidelines:

        1. **Mandatory and optional sections:**
           - What sections should always be included in every README?
           - What sections are optional based on project type?

        2. **Project-specific sections:**
           - Can the assistant suggest additional sections based on the specific project needs? (e.g., "API Reference" for a library, "Deployment" for a web app)

        3. **Writing style:**
           - What writing style should the assistant use? (e.g., formal/technical, conversational, concise bullet points vs detailed explanations)
           - Any specific tone or voice preferences?

        4. **Section length management:**
           - Should the assistant suggest migrating a section to a separate .md file if it becomes too long?
           - If yes, what's the threshold for "too long"?

        1.
        Mandatory:
        - Project Title and Overview
        - Getting Started
            a. Requirements
            b. Installation (if applicable)
        - Usage
        - Features
        - License
        - Contact Information
        
        Optional:
        - Table of Contents (for longer READMEs)
        - Testing (if tests exist)
        - Configuration
        - API Documentation
        - Deployment
        - Contributing
        - Credits/Acknowledgments

        2. Yes
        3. direct, concise and clear for non-native English speakers
        4.
        - Yes
        - If it hinders the readability of the main README.
    </user>
    <thinking>
        Excellent, I now have all the information needed to create the README assistant prompt:

        1. **System prompt** - confirmed
        2. **Chain of Thought** - yes, I need to include the thinking_behavior section
        3. **Prompt chaining** - I'll structure this as three distinct phases

        Key requirements gathered:
        - Mandatory sections: Project Title/Overview, Getting Started (Requirements, Installation), Usage, Features, License, Contact
        - Optional sections: ToC, Testing, Configuration, API Docs, Deployment, Contributing, Credits
        - Project-specific sections allowed (good flexibility)
        - Writing style: direct, concise, clear for non-native speakers
        - Long sections can be split into separate files when they hinder readability

        I'll create a system prompt that:
        - Defines the assistant as a README documentation expert
        - Implements the 3-phase approach (info gathering → outline → section-by-section writing)
        - Includes the thinking_behavior section since CoT was requested
        - Uses proper XML structure with semantic tags
        - Incorporates all the README requirements and best practices
        - Ensures the assistant writes in an accessible style
        - Includes the critical constraint about writing sections in markdown code blocks
