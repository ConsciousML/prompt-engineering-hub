    <user>
        Hi README expert, I would like to create a README for my repository.
        It's a simple project named 'claude-prompt-catalog'.

        Here's the tree:
        .
        ├── LICENSE
        └── prompts
            ├── insight_extractor
            │   └── system.xml
            ├── prompt_generator
            │   ├── examples.xml
            │   ├── system.xml
            │   └── user_facing_prompts
            │       └── evaluate_insights.xml
            └── readme-writer
                └── system.xml

        It contains system prompt and examples. No prog language.
        I share my prompts in this repo to help people.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            Let me analyze what information the user has provided:
            - Project name: "claude-prompt-catalog" ✓
            - Project type: Simple project with prompts ✓
            - File structure: Provided complete tree ✓
            - Content type: System prompts and examples ✓
            - Programming language: None (not a code project) ✓
            - Purpose: Share prompts to help people ✓

            Critical missing information for a comprehensive README:
            - Specific requirements (software, accounts, dependencies)
            - How to actually use these prompts
            - Target audience specifics
            - Installation/setup process
            - Any prerequisites or prior knowledge needed
            - License information
            - Contribution guidelines (if open to contributions)

            I should start by asking about requirements since that's fundamental for users to know if they can use this project.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Thank you for providing the project structure! I can see you have a collection of Claude prompts organized by different use cases.

        Before I create an outline for your README, I need to understand a couple of key things:

        1. Are there any specific requirements to use these prompts (like needing a Claude account or subscription)?

        2. Are you planning to accept contributions from the community?

        This will help me determine which sections to include in the README outline.
        Does your project have some specific requirements?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Yes, users need a Claude.ai account. Some prompts need a subscription for Custom Projects, but others work with the free tier.

        And definitely yes to contributions! I want this to grow with community input.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            Now I have enough information to create a meaningful outline:
            - It's a prompt collection for Claude
            - Has requirements (Claude account, some need subscription)
            - Open to community contributions
            - No programming/installation needed
            - Has a LICENSE file

            Based on this, I should include:
            - Overview/Purpose
            - Requirements (important since there are account needs)
            - Quick Start/Usage
            - Catalog of available prompts
            - Repository structure explanation
            - Contributing section (since they want community input)
            - License (they have a LICENSE file)

            I'll present the outline now.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        Perfect! Based on what you've shared, here's my suggested outline for your README:
        ```markdown
        # Claude Prompt Catalog
        - intro phrase
        ## Purpose
        ## Requirements
        ## Quick Start
        ## Prompt Catalog
        - table with the available prompts
        ## Repository Structure
        - with an explanation of file types.
        ## Contribution
        ## License
        ```
        Does this outline cover what you're looking for? Would you like to add or remove any sections?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Great! Let's start writing.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the title and introduction section, I have:
            - Project name: "Claude Prompt Catalog" ✓
            - Purpose: Share prompts to help people ✓
            - It's for Claude AI ✓

            I have enough information to write a clear, concise introduction.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        Amazing! I'll start right away with the overview:
        ```markdown
        # Claude Prompt Catalog

        A curated collection of prompts for [Claude](https://claude.ai/), designed to help users get the most out of their favorite AI assistant.
        ```
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Perfect! Let's continue with the next section.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Purpose section, I have:
            - Basic purpose: help people by sharing prompts ✓
            - It's a catalog/collection ✓

            But I need more details about:
            - Is it for learning, direct use, or both?
            - Any prompt engineering techniques?
            - Any methodologies or best practices it follows?

            I should ask for clarification.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        From what you've shared, this appears to be a repository designed to help people by providing proper prompting examples for Claude. The repository contains system prompts and examples organized by different use cases.

        Is there any additional context about the purpose I should know? For instance:
        - Is this meant to be a learning resource, a ready-to-use collection, or both?
        - Are there specific prompt engineering techniques you want to highlight?
        - Do you want to reference any official documentation or best practices?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Good questions! Yes, it's both a resource and learning hub. 
        The prompts follow Anthropic's prompt engineering documentation.
        People can use them directly or learn from their structure.
        I also want to encourage contributions from the community!
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            {{THINKING_THAT_WE_HAVE_ENOUGH_INFO}}
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        
        Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. Here's the Purpose section:
        ```markdown
        ## Purpose
        This catalog serves as both a resource and learning hub, providing working examples of [Anthropic's prompt engineering documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) in action.

        Use these prompts:
        - Right off the bat if they fit some of your needs.
        - To learn from their structure
        - To get inspiration to craft your own prompts
        - To contribute back to help the community!
        ```

        Does this capture the essence of what you want to achieve with this catalog?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Yes, exactly! Next section please.
        You can mention in a note that these prompts are for Claude but can be tested for other LLMs.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Requirements section, I have all necessary information:
            - Claude.ai account needed ✓
            - Subscription for Custom Projects ✓  
            - Free tier works for user-facing prompts ✓
            - Note about testing with other LLMs ✓

            I can write this section without asking for more information.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Now for the Requirements section. I already have all the information I need from what you shared earlier about Claude.ai accounts and subscriptions.

        ```markdown
        ## Requirements
        - [**Claude.ai account**](https://claude.ai/): free account works for user-facing prompts.
        - [**Claude subscription**](https://claude.ai/settings/billing?action=subscribe): required for Custom Projects (system prompts).

        **Note**: the prompts of this catalog has been designed specifically for Claude. But feel free to test them with other LLMs.
        ```

        I've made the requirements clear and added links for easy access. What do you think?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Perfect formatting! Continue.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Quick Start section, I need to know:
            - How users actually set up and use these prompts
            - The workflow for Custom Projects vs regular use
            - Specific steps depending on prompt type?

            I don't have this information yet, so I need to ask.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Moving to the Quick Start section. I need to understand how users should get started with these prompts.

        What's the actual setup workflow? Do users:
        - Copy and paste prompts directly into Claude?
        - Need to set up Custom Projects?
        - Follow specific steps depending on the prompt type?

        This will help me write a clear Quick Start section.
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Good question! There are actually two ways:
        1. Create a Custom Claude Project (recommended) - users go to the Projects page, create a new project, paste the system.xml content into project instructions, and upload the examples.xml file
        2. Use in regular conversations - for quick tasks or without subscription, they can paste system.xml directly at the start of a conversation, or use the user_facing_prompts directly

        Each approach has specific steps depending on whether it's a system prompt or user-facing prompt.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            The user has provided two approaches:
            1. Custom Claude Project - involves Projects page, creating new project, pasting system.xml, uploading examples.xml
            2. Regular conversations - paste system.xml directly or use user_facing_prompts

            This is quite detailed but I need more specific UI/workflow information:
            - Exact location of Projects page
            - Step-by-step UI interactions
            - Where exactly to paste content
            - How file uploads work

            Since these are specific UI elements users will need to follow, I should ask for precise details to ensure the instructions are accurate and easy to follow.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        I see! This sounds like there are specific UI elements and workflows in Claude that I should reference accurately.

        I'm not familiar with the exact Claude web interface - could you guide me on the specific steps? For example:
        - Where exactly is the Projects page located?
        - What does the interface look like when creating a new project?
        - How do users paste content into project instructions?
        - Is there a specific way to upload the examples.xml file?

        This will help me write clear, accurate instructions that users can easily follow.
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Sure! Here are the detailed steps:
        1. Go to the Projects page at claude.ai/projects
        2. Click on the "New project" button
        3. Write a name for the project (e.g., "Prompt Generator")
        4. On the right, below "Project Knowledge" click "Edit"
        5. Copy the content of prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml
        6. Paste into project instructions
        7. Drag and drop the prompts/prompt_generator/example.xml file
        8. Start a conversation by writing in the text box below the project name

        For regular conversations, they just paste at the start of any Claude chat.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            The user has provided very detailed UI steps:
            - Navigate to claude.ai/projects
            - Click "New project" 
            - Enter project name
            - Edit Project Knowledge section
            - Copy/paste system.xml
            - Drag and drop examples.xml
            - Start conversation

            This is quite comprehensive with multiple setup paths and specific UI interactions. A Quick Start section should be brief and get users started quickly. With this level of detail, including it all would make the section too long and potentially overwhelming.

            Best practice would be to keep the Quick Start minimal and link to a separate, detailed setup guide. This keeps the README clean while still providing users with all the information they need.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        Thank you for the detailed steps! This is quite comprehensive with multiple setup paths and specific UI interactions. Given the complexity, I suggest we keep the Quick Start section brief and create a separate `docs/setup-guide.md` file with the full instructions.

        Here's what I propose for the Quick Start section:

        ```markdown
        ## Quick Start
        See our [Setup Guide](docs/setup-guide.md) for detailed instructions on using these prompts.
        ```

        This keeps the README clean while providing a clear path to detailed setup instructions. What do you think about this approach?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Great idea! Yes, let's do that.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            {{THINKING_THAT_WE_HAVE_ENOUGH_INFO}}
        &lt;/thinking&gt;

        Ok I'll write the `docs/setup-guide.md` then.
        ```markdown
            # Claude Prompt Setup Guide
            This documentation shows you how-to use the custom prompts from this catalog.

            ## Option 1: Create a Custom Claude Project (Recommended)
            For specialized workflows, create a dedicated Claude assistant using the Prompt Generator as an example:

            1. Go to the [Projects page](https://claude.ai/projects)
            2. Click on the `New project` button
            3. Write a name for the project (e.g., "Prompt Generator")
            4. On the right, below `Project Knowledge` click `Edit`
            5. Copy the content of `prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml`
            6. Paste into project instructions
            7. Drag and drop the `prompts/prompt_generator/example.xml` file
            8. See this [example](prompts/prompt_generator/examples.xml) for guidance on how to use the Prompt Generator.
            9. Start a conversation on by writing your first prompt in the text box below `Prompt Generator`.


            ## Option 2: Use in Regular Conversations
            Use this option for quick one-off tasks or if you don't have a Claude subscription.

            For system prompts (without subscription):
            1. Copy the contents of any `system.xml` file
            2. Paste directly at the start of a Claude conversation
            3. See this [example](prompts/prompt_generator/examples.xml) for guidance on how to use the Prompt Generator.

            For user-facing prompts:
            1. Copy the contents of any file in `user_facing_prompts/` folders
            2. Paste directly into a Claude conversation
            3. Replace placeholders like `[SPECIFIC_TASK]` with your details
        ```
    </assistant>
    <user>
        That is awesome! Let's continue.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Prompt Catalog section, I know:
            - Three prompts exist: insight_extractor, prompt_generator, readme-writer ✓
            - Their file structure from the initial tree ✓

            But I don't know:
            - What each prompt actually does
            - How to best present them (table, list, cards?)
            - Whether there's more documentation for each
            - If there are other prompts not shown in the tree

            I need descriptions of each prompt to create a meaningful catalog that helps users choose the right prompt for their needs.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Ok! Let's proceed with the Prompt Catalog section.
        I can see from your repository structure that you have three prompts:
        - insight_extractor
        - prompt_generator  
        - readme-writer

        To create a useful catalog, I'd need to know:
        - What does each prompt do?
        - Should we present them in a table format?
        - Do you want to include links to more detailed documentation for each?
        - Are there any additional prompts I should know about?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Yes, table format would be perfect! Let me share the system prompts so you can understand what each one does.

        Here's the prompt_generator system prompt:
        [shares prompts/prompt_generator/system.xml content]

        Here's the insight_extractor:
        [shares prompts/insight_extractor/system.xml content]

        And here's the readme-writer:
        [shares prompts/readme-writer/system.xml content]
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            {{THINKING_THAT_WE_HAVE_ENOUGH_INFO}}
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Thank you for sharing those system prompts! After reviewing each one, I can see their distinct purposes. Here's the Prompt Catalog section:

        ```markdown
        ## Prompt Catalog
        Here's a table with available prompts:
        | Assistant | Description |
        |--------|-------------|
        | **Prompt Generator** | A comprehensive system for creating effective Claude prompts using advanced techniques like chain-of-thought, prompt chaining, and XML formatting. Follows Anthropic's best practices. |
        | **Insight Extractor** | Extracts key findings from articles, research papers, forums, and other content sources. Includes source referencing with text fragment linking for verification. |
        | **README Writer** | A structured, iterative approach to creating comprehensive project documentation. Guides you through information gathering, outline creation, and section-by-section writing. |
        ```

        Would you like me to add links to the individual README files for the prompts that have them?
    </assistant>
    </example>
    <user>
        Looks great! Let's proceed.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Repository Structure section, I have:
            - Complete file tree from the user's initial message ✓
            - Understanding of file types (system.xml, examples.xml, user_facing_prompts) ✓
            - Knowledge of how these files are used from previous discussions ✓

            I should:
            - Present the structure clearly
            - Explain what each file type is for
            - Help users understand the organization pattern

            I have all the information needed to write this section.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Now for the Repository Structure section. Based on the tree structure you showed me earlier, here's how the project is organized:

        ```markdown
        ## Repository Structure
        ```
        claude-prompt-catalog/
        ├── prompts/
        │   ├── prompt_generator/
        │   │   ├── system.xml
        │   │   ├── examples.xml
        │   │   └── user_facing_prompts/
        │   │       └── evaluate_insights.xml
        │   ├── insight_extractor/
        │   │   └── ...             # same structure
        │   └── readme_writer/
        │       └── ...             # same structure 
        ```

        Here's a brief description of each file type:
        - `system.xml`: system prompts for Custom Claude Projects. Copy these into Project Instructions.
        - `user_facing_prompts/`: ready-to-use prompts for direct conversation. Copy and paste into Claude chats.
        - `examples.xml`: example files to upload to Custom Projects alongside system prompts.
        ```
    </assistant>
    <user>
        Perfect! Continue to the next section.
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the Contributing section, I know:
            - The user wants community contributions ✓
            - They mentioned this earlier when asked ✓

            But I don't have:
            - Specific contribution guidelines
            - Format requirements
            - Types of prompts accepted
            - Quality standards
            - Submission process (PRs, issues, etc.)

            Since this is an important section for a community-driven project, I should ask for these details rather than assuming standard practices.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Moving on to the Contributing section.

        You mentioned earlier that you want to encourage contributions from the community. Do you have any specific guidelines for contributions? For example:
        - What format should contributors follow?
        - Should they submit system prompts, user-facing prompts, or both?
        - Any quality standards or testing requirements?
        - How should they submit contributions (pull requests, issues)?
    </assistant>
    <user>
        I trust you to use common contribution guidelines. Just make sure it's clear and welcoming!
    </user>
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            The user trusts me to create standard contribution guidelines and wants them to be:
            - Clear ✓
            - Welcoming ✓

            Contribution sections can include many details:
            - How to submit (PRs, branches, etc.)
            - File structure requirements
            - Testing guidelines
            - Code of conduct
            - Review process

            Including all of this in the README would make it lengthy. Best practice is to have a brief, welcoming section in the README that links to detailed guidelines. This follows the same pattern we used for the setup guide.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Since contribution guidelines can be quite detailed, I suggest keeping the Contributing section in the README brief and creating a separate `docs/contribution.md` file with comprehensive guidelines. This keeps the README clean while providing contributors with all the information they need.

        Would you like me to create both the brief Contributing section for the README and the detailed contribution guidelines file?

            I need to create two things:
            1. A brief Contributing section for the README - should be welcoming and point to detailed docs
            2. A detailed contribution.md file with comprehensive guidelines

            For the README section:
            - Keep it brief and welcoming ✓
            - Link to detailed documentation ✓
            - Thank contributors ✓

            For the detailed guidelines, I should include:
            - Reference to Anthropic's best practices
            - Clear file structure requirements
            - Submission process (standard GitHub workflow)
            - Testing requirements
            - How to organize new prompts

            I'll use standard open-source contribution practices while keeping the tone welcoming and clear.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Perfect! First, here's the Contributing section for the README:

        ```markdown
        ## Contributing
        We welcome contributions from the community! Help us grow this collection by sharing your prompts.

        See the [contributing documentation](docs/contribution.md) for detailed guidelines.

        Thank you for helping make Claude more useful for everyone!
        ```

        And here's the detailed `docs/contribution.md` file:

        ```markdown
        # Contribution Guidelines
        Please familiarize yourself with [Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) to ensure your prompts follow best practices.

        ## Submission Guidelines

        1. Create a new folder under `prompts/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `data_analyzer`, `meeting_summarizer`)
        2. Include a `system.xml` file with your system prompt
        3. Add `user_facing_prompts/` folder if your prompt includes prompt templates.
        4. Follow XML formatting as shown in existing prompts
        5. Test your prompt thoroughly before submitting

        ## File Structure Requirements
        ```
        prompts/your_prompt_name/
        ├── system.xml
        └── user_facing_prompts/          # Optional: Conversational examples
        ├── examples.xml
        ```

        ## How to Submit
        1. Fork this repository
        2. Create a new branch for your prompt
        3. Add your prompt following the guidelines above
        4. Update this README's Prompt Catalog table
        5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

        Thank you for helping make Claude more useful for everyone!
        ```

        Does this provide clear guidance for contributors?

        That's perfect! Very clear and welcoming. Let's finish with the License section.
    </user> 
    <assistant>
        &lt;thinking&gt;
            For the License section, I need:
            - The specific license type - NOT PROVIDED
            - Any special attribution requirements - NOT PROVIDED

            I can see from the initial tree structure that there's a LICENSE file in the repository, but I don't know which license it contains. I should ask rather than assume.
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        For the final License section, I can see you have a LICENSE file in your repository. What type of license are you using? This will help me write the appropriate text and attribution.
    </assistant>
    <user>
        It's Apache License 2.0

            {{THINKING_THAT_WE_HAVE_ENOUGH_INFO}}
        &lt;/thinking&gt;
        Great! Here's the License section:

        ```markdown
        ## License
        This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

        Feel free to use, modify, and distribute these prompts in your own projects!
        ```
