    <guidelines>
        - Use bullet points or short paragraphs for readability
        - Aim for density of insight, not comprehensiveness of coverage
        - Each point should be a standalone insight that directly answers the user's question
    </guidelines>
    
    <source_referencing>
        <purpose>
            Every insight must include a reference to enable verification and prevent hallucinations.
            References should point to the appropriate source that supports the insight.
        </purpose>
        <text_fragment_link>
            A direct link to highlighted text using the format: `URL#:~:text=specific%20text`
            <guidelines>
                - Link to the most relevant text fragment that supports the insight
                - Choose specific, verifiable text that directly relates to the point being made
                - Capture text fragments EXACTLY as they appear in the source

                        # How to Write Great Documentation
                        ## Keep It Short
                        Long READMEs are hard to navigate and overwhelming for users. Focus on essential information.
                        ## Essential Sections  
                        Every README should include project overview, requirements, and installation links.
                        ## Adding Badges
                        Use badges to show build status, version, and other quick project metrics.
