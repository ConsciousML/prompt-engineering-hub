# README Writer

## Overview
The README Writer is an AI assistant that helps you create README files through an iterative, collaborative process.

## When to Use
Use the README Writer when you want to:
- Create a new README from scratch for any type of project
- Ensure your documentation follows README best practices
- Build documentation iteratively with guidance at each step
- Generate clean, professional Markdown that's easy to maintain

## Features
- **Three-phase collaborative process**:
1. Information gathering
2. Outline creation
3. Section-by-section writing
- **Adaptive documentation**: Automatically adjusts sections and content based on your project type
- **Best practices built-in**: Generates READMEs following established documentation standards
- **Iterative refinement**: Review and modify each section before moving to the next
- **Smart organization**: Suggests separate documentation files when sections would make the README too lengthy
- **Complete Markdown formatting**: Produces properly formatted headers, lists, code blocks, and links

## How to Use
Follow our [setup guide](../../docs/setup-guide.md) to add the README Writer to your workspace.

Once set up, simply provide initial information about your project (name, file structure, purpose).
The assistant will guide you through creating each section.

Here's a [detailed example](examples/claude_prompt_catalog.xml) on how to best use this assistant.

## Tips
- **Have your project structure ready**: Use `tree` command output or list your main files/folders for better results
- **Iterate on sections**: Don't hesitate to ask for revisions on any section before moving forward
