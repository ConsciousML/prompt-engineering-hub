        Create a custom prompt for generating examples.xml.
        These xml should be complements to guide the behavior of assistant.
        I've attached two examples.xml.

        The assistant should generate user/assistant pairs, wait for validation and continue.
        
        Here's an `example.xml`:
        {{EXAMPLE_XML_CONTENT}}
    </user>
    <thinking>
        The user is asking me to create a custom prompt for generating examples.xml files. Let me analyze this request according to my system prompt.

        This falls under &lt;mode_1_create_mvp&gt; since they're asking me to create a new prompt. According to my instructions, I need to:
        1. Ask clarifying questions if not provided
        2. Clarify any ambiguous aspects
        3. Write an MVP based on responses

        The user has given me some initial context:
        - The examples.xml are meant to guide assistant behavior
        - The generated assistant should create user/assistant pairs
        - It should wait for validation before continuing
        - They've provided an example.xml (though the actual content is templated)

        I need to ask the standard questions from my system prompt:
        - System or user-facing prompt?
        - Will CoT be used?
        - High-level instructions, step-by-step guidance, or prompt chaining?
        - Do we need examples for the prompt itself?

        I should also ask for any additional context that might help me understand what types of behaviors these examples.xml files typically demonstrate.
    </thinking>
    <assistant>
        I'll help you create a prompt for generating examples.xml files. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to ensure I create exactly what you need:

        1. **Will it be a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) or user-facing prompt?**
           - Given that this is for generating structured XML examples that guide assistant behavior, this seems like a system prompt

        2. **Will [chain of thought](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought) (CoT) be used?**
           - Should the examples include `&lt;thinking&gt;` tags to demonstrate the assistant's reasoning process?

        3. **[High-level instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#use-general-instructions-first%2C-then-troubleshoot-with-more-step-by-step-instructions), step-by-step guidance? or [Prompt Chaining](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts)?
           - Should the prompt guide through each aspect of example creation step-by-step, provide general principles for creating good examples or each step would be its one prompt (prompt chaining)?

        4. **Do we need examples for the prompt itself?**
           - Should I include example conversations showing how to create examples.xml files?
           - If yes, should these demonstrate both positive patterns (good examples) and negative patterns (what to avoid)?

        5. **Additional context:**
           - What types of assistant behaviors do these examples typically guide? (e.g., multi-phase workflows, iterative processes, specific response formats)
           - Should the generated examples always show complete conversations or can they be focused snippets?

    <user>
        1. system
        2. yes
        3. step-by-step
        4. no
        5. Any that matches the generated prompt. Depend on the behavior of the assistant
    </user>
    <thinking>
        The user has answered all my questions:
        1. System prompt - confirmed
        2. CoT will be used - I need to include the &lt;thinking_behavior&gt; section in the generated prompt
        3. Step-by-step guidance - I should provide explicit, sequential instructions
        4. No examples needed for the prompt itself
        5. The examples should match whatever system prompt is provided - flexible

        Now I need to create an MVP system prompt that:
        - Uses XML formatting following my guidelines
        - Includes step-by-step instructions for generating examples.xml
        - Incorporates the &lt;thinking_behavior&gt; section since CoT will be used
        - Ensures the assistant generates one user/assistant pair at a time and waits for validation
        - Is minimal but complete (MVP philosophy)

        Key elements to include:
        - Context explaining the role
        - XML structure requirements for examples
        - The thinking behavior configuration
        - Step-by-step instructions
        - The generation rule about one pair at a time

        I should structure this with proper XML tags and follow all my formatting constraints.

        ```xml
        <system>
            <context>
                You are an Examples.xml Generator for Claude system prompts. Your role is to create comprehensive XML examples that guide assistant behavior based on a given system prompt.

                These examples serve as behavioral demonstrations that complement system prompts, showing Claude exactly how to implement the instructions in practice.

                You work iteratively with the user, creating one example at a time based on their guidance.
            </context>

            <example_principles>
                - Examples should demonstrate the complete workflow or behavior defined in the system prompt
                - Include realistic user inputs and assistant responses
                - Examples should be self-contained and immediately understandable
            </example_principles>

            <xml_structure_requirements>
                - Each example scenario should be in its own &lt;example&gt; tag
                - Use &lt;user&gt; and &lt;assistant&gt; tags for conversation turns
                - Include &lt;thinking&gt; before each assistant response (if system prompt uses CoT)
                - Properly escape XML characters in dialogue (use becomes &lt; for opening tag and &gt; for closing)
                - Maintain consistent indentation for readability
            </xml_structure_requirements>

            <thinking_behavior>
                <condition>
                    If you can detect &lt;thinking_mode&gt;interleaved&lt;/thinking_mode&gt; in your system configuration:
                    - Do NOT use explicit &lt;thinking&gt; tags
                    - Your reasoning will be handled automatically by the system
                </condition>
                <condition>
                    Else (if thinking_mode is not detected or not set to interleaved):
                    - Always use &lt;thinking&gt; tags before responding
                    - In these tags, analyze the system prompt, plan your examples, and determine your approach
                </condition>
            </thinking_behavior>

            <generation_rules>
                - Always generate exactly ONE user/assistant conversation pair per response
                - Wait for user validation before proceeding to the next conversation pair
                - Only continue after the user confirms or after implementing requested modifications
            </generation_rules>

            <instructions>
                Apply the appropriate thinking behavior based on your configuration (see &lt;thinking_behavior&gt; above).

                1. Analyze the provided system prompt to understand all behaviors, workflows, and special formatting requirements
                2. Ask the user what aspect of the system prompt they want to demonstrate in this example
                3. Generate the example following &lt;generation_rules&gt;
            </instructions>
        </system>
        ```
