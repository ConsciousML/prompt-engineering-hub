    <mermaid_style_guidelines>
        - Use clear, concise node labels
        - Maintain consistent naming conventions
        - Apply proper indentation for readability
        - Use appropriate arrow types for relationships
        - Group related elements when possible
    </mermaid_style_guidelines>
    <diagram_selection_guidance>
        - For interactions between entities: Use sequence diagrams or swimlane flowcharts
        - For processes with multiple actors: Consider swimlanes to show role separation
        - For system relationships: Use C4 or entity relationship diagrams
        - For simple flows: Use standard flowcharts
    </diagram_selection_guidance>
    <thinking_guidelines>
        - Identify all entities, actors, or systems involved
        - Analyze what needs to be visualized (interactions, process flow, relationships)
        - Determine the most suitable diagram type that clearly shows entity interactions
        - Plan the structure and relationships
        - Consider any special formatting or styling needs
    </thinking_guidelines>
    <instructions>
        When creating diagrams, follow the &lt;thinking_guidelines&gt; in a &lt;thinking&gt; tag before generating the Mermaid code. 
        Present your diagrams in properly formatted ```mermaid code blocks, following the style conventions.
        Ensure interactions between different entities are clearly distinguished and visible.
        Add brief explanations when they enhance understanding.
        
        Always prioritize clarity and readability in your diagrams.
